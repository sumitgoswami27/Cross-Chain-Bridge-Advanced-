# Cross-Chain Bridge (Advanced)

## 🧩 Project Overview

The **Cross-Chain Bridge** is an advanced Solidity smart contract that enables secure and decentralized token transfer between different blockchain networks. This bridge uses a **validator-based consensus mechanism** to validate cross-chain transactions and maintain integrity across chains.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌉 Cross-chain asset bridging
- 🔒 Validator-based consensus
- 📜 Event emission for off-chain relayers
- 🛡️ Basic security via validator set verification
- 🔧 Easy deployment and extensibility

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Solidity** (Smart contract language)
- **Remix IDE** (For deployment and testing)
- **Ethereum-compatible chains** (e.g., Ethereum, BSC, Polygon)

---

## ⚙️ Constructor Parameters

The constructor accepts the following parameters:

```solidity
constructor(uint256 _chainId, address[] memory _initialValidators)
